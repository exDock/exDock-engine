= exDock

An ecommerce platform built with Kotlin, Vert.x, and Docker

This application is managed via the following Github project:
https://github.com/users/rensPols/projects/2/views/1

The backend UI is currently being developed in the following repo:
https://github.com/exDock/exDock-backend-client

== Why exDock?

exDock addresses key limitations of existing open-source ecommerce solutions:

1. *Performance:* Most platforms are built on PHP, an interpreted language, which can lead to slower performance. exDock leverages Kotlin and Vert.x for improved speed and reduced CPU usage.

2. *Efficiency:* The combination of Kotlin and Vert.x has the potential to significantly reduce load times and operational costs.

3. *Easy Deployment:* Built with Docker, exDock simplifies the setup process. Users can pull the Docker image and complete the configuration through their browser, streamlining deployment.

By focusing on these aspects, exDock aims to provide a faster, more cost-effective, and user-friendly ecommerce solution.

== How to deploy exDock
image:https://img.shields.io/badge/vert.x-4.5.9-purple.svg[link="https://vertx.io"]

1. *Pull* the Docker image
2. *Run* the Docker image
3. Follow the *GUI settings*

== How it works
exDock is a Vert.x server that is run in a Docker container.
This is the basis for the eCommerce platform.
In order to extend the exDock functionality, you need to pull an additional Docker image.
This image can then collaborate with the exDock main container and extend the functionality.

When extra core functionality is required,
it is possible to fork this repository and as long as the connection layer isn't altered,
it should work fine. +
!attention: Although possible, it is not recommended behaviour.
